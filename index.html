        This document provides an overview of how web applications have started
        to be integrated into native application environments, and outlines the
        use cases and requirements for a standard that could allow users to
        "install" web applications. The use cases and requirements were
        gathered by examining the landscape of proprietary solutions, and,
        where possible, by gathering statistics about the prevalence and usage
        patterns of particular solutions used in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proprietary solutions that integrate web applications into the
        underlying operating system have been used in the wild for a few years
        now, so consolidation towards a standardized solution could potentially
        benefit users, developers, and browser vendors.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        To launch native applications on either a desktop-class machine or a
        mobile device, users are generally presented with icons and
        corresponding labels that represent the applications installed on their
        system. Having the icons of web applications appear amongst
        applications that the user considers native (e.g., those on the home
        screen of a device) gives the perception to users that a web
        application has been "installed" - even if the processes that go into
        actually "installing" a web application differ from those of a native
        application.
      </p>

          Mavericks.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        At the time of writing, the web platform lacks a standardized means for
        a web application to indicate that it can be "installed" and treated as
        if it were an native application. As this document will show, the web
        platform also lacks sufficient metadata for a Web application to be
        successfully integrated into an underlying platform in the same way
        native applications are (i.e., not just on the homescreen, but 
        integration into other contexts such as the task switcher, privacy
        and security settings, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this gap in the web platform, browser vendors, including
        Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, have implemented proprietary
        solutions that allow users to add web applications to the homescreen.
        To get a web application to more fully integrate with the OS,
        developers are sometimes required to use proprietary opt-in mechanisms,
        which we discuss later, to indicate to the browser that the web
        application can potentially work as a stand-alone application once it's
        added to the homescreen. These opt-in mechanisms primarily provide the
        OS with metadata (e.g., the icons and name of the application) so when
        the web application is added to the homescreen, it appears
        indistinguishable from an application that was natively installed.

      <h2>
        Bookmarking
      </h2>
      <p>
        To access a web application, users traditionally opened up a web
        browser, typed a URL or a search query into a search box, and had the
        browser navigate to the web application they wanted. Alternatively, a
        user may have "bookmarked" within a Web browser a set of web documents
        or web applications they commonly access.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, browsers have started to monitor user's browsing habits
        to intelligently deduce which are the most common web sites the user
        likes to visit (i.e., a type of automatic bookmarking). The browser
        will then present visual links to those sites. Depending on the
        browser, user-defined and automatically-gleaned bookmarks will appear
        as a list of document titles or file names in either a drop-down menu,
        "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Speed_Dial">speed-dial</a>"
        entries, a toolbar, and/or a dedicated application window or tab. All
        these bookmark types are illustrated below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/desktop_bookmarking.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          In a desktop-based browser, there are at least six different ways to
          access bookmarks. Some of those bookmarks are derived dynamically by
          monitoring user's browsing habits, such as the most visited sites and
          "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Speed_Dial">speed
          dial</a>" entries the user sees when they open a new tab.

        <h3>
          Bookmarking on mobile browsers
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile devices, the interaction model has traditionally been the
          same as the one described above: historically, there's been a clear
          distinction between opening a native application and accessing a web
          application. That is, to access a Web application a user needs to
          first locate the Web browser they want to use, launch it, and then
          either type-in a URL or select a bookmark. Web browsers on mobile
          operating systems have thus added similar bookmarking facilities as
          those found in desktop-class browsers. This is shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mobile_bookmarks.jpg" alt=
          "From left to right, the bookmarking facilities of Safari on iOS, Android 4.3 stock browser, Chrome on iOS, Internet Explorer 10 on Windows Phone 8, and Firefox OS's default browser.">
          <figcaption>
            The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers closely resemble
            those of desktop-browsers - providing both a traditional list of
            bookmarks as well as a "speed dial" that can contain either
            automatically gleaned bookmarks or user-configured ones.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers helps reduce some of
          the burden of typing URLs. Particularly for sites that the user
          visits regularly, it means that a web site can be accessed by a
          single press. Additionally, bookmarking facilities help separate
          native applications from web sites the user needs to access for other
          reasons (e.g., a particular wiki page on an intranet, a document with
          commonly required information, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table shows some examples of how a user bookmarks a
          page on a mobile browser. Both iOS and Android provide the user with
          the ability to customize the name of the bookmark, as well as
          organize the bookmark by placing it into a particular location.
          Firefox OS, however, simply let's the user "star" a page - this gives
          the user the option to bookmark the page. Once bookmarked, the site
          is added to a bookmarks tab (not shown below), which, unlike other
          mobile browsers, does not provide a means to manipulate the metadata
          of the bookmark. On Windows Phone the user can "add favorite". It
          does not allow the user to choose the location when adding a site,
          however, IE Mobile has a separated option called, "Pin to start".

        <h3>
          Side-effects of bookmarking: multiple home screens
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because basic bookmarks contain links to a range of different types
          of resources, the bookmarking facilities of desktop and mobile
          browsers do not integrate into an operating system's application
          menu. This means that web applications and "native" applications are
          treated as different things. This separation makes sense for many
          kinds of web sites (e.g., static, informational websites that provide
          little other functionality), but there is a range of applications
          that can provide an experience that is analogous to that provided by
          an application installed locally on a user's device (e.g., a game, an
          office productivity suite, a news or social networking site, a
          currency converter or photo manipulation utility, etc.). That said,
          it is users who are in the best position to decide what they consider
          an "app" and where they would like to access it from (either as a
          bookmark or as one of their locally installed applications).
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below, this desire to treat websites as applications has led
          at least one browser maker to attempt to replicate the homescreen
          experience directly in the browser itself.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/ios_default_tab.png" alt=""> <img src=
          "images/iOS_homescreen.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>
            In iOS 7's Safari web browser, the default tab view presents icons
            derived from websites to create what is, in effect, a second
            homescreen - image on the left. This can be clearly seen when
            contrasted with the actual iOS 7 homescreen -image on the right.
            Google Chrome's browser, although not shown here, does the same
            thing in iOS: it presents bookmarked pages as a grid of icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this is a convenient way to access web sites, there are web
          applications that would benefit users if they were directly available
          from where the user normally accesses their installed applications.
          Also relegating web applications to this second homescreen means that
          web applications are treated as "second-class citizens": in the sense
          that in order to access these applications, a user must first launch
          the correct browser (from potentially a range of different browsers),
          and then press the icon for the application they wish to load.

        <h3>
          Key components of bookmarking
        </h3>
        <p>
          From the discussion above, we can conclude that the key bits of
          information that are needed to enable bookmarking are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Name (label or title):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Generally this will be the title of the page being bookmarked.
            Mobile browsers usually allow users to change this, specially when
            bookmarking to the homescreen.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Icon:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Generally, the site's favicon. However, proprietary solutions exist
            that allow the browser to select from a range of icons.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            URL:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The URL to be loaded when the user activates the bookmark.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Organization:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Browsers generally provide some facility to allow bookmarks to be
            organized (e.g., into folders).

      <h2>
        Add to homescreen
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, web applications should be immediately available to users
        without them needing to launch a separate application (a web browser)
        and having to type a URL. A user may have found a web application
        through browsing the web (e.g., through a search engine, via a link
        given to them by a friend on a social network, or through a website
        that works as an "app store"), but once added to the homescreen, the
        developer needs to be able to control if in web application opens in a
        Web browser environment or if the application is launched
        <dfn>standalone</dfn>: that is, once the application is launched, it
        appears indistinguishable from a native application by allowing the OS
        to treat it as equivalent to a native application. This includes, but
        is not limited to, integration with OS facilities such as the task
        switcher and doing away with browser UI chrome (the address bar,
        forward/back buttons, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some browser makers have long acknowledged this as something developers
        want and that users could benefit from: iOS's Safari has had the
        capability to add a website to the homescreen since early 2008 (as of
        version 1.1.3, as shown in the figure below); the Android's stock
        browser has provided the capability to "add to homescreen" since at
        least 2009. Windows 8 also provides a similar capability, called
        "pinning", which we discuss in more detail below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/early_addtohomescreen.jpg" alt="iOS 1.1.3">
        <figcaption>
          iOS's Safari has almost always provided a way for users to add
          websites to the home screen of the device. Once the user presses
          "add", the icon for the Web application is placed along side other
          native application icons.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The ability to add a web site to the homescreen didn't automatically
        make a web application look, feel, or integrate into the operating
        system in the same way as native applications did. For instance,
        originally in iOS, launching a web application that had been added to
        the homescreen took the user back into Safari; in other words, it
        worked just like a traditional bookmark. It was only with the release
        of iOS 2.2 in September 2008 that applications that had been added to
        the home screen gained the capability to be displayed full screen
        (i.e., doing away with Safari's application chrome, as shown below).
        Apple did this by introducing a proprietary bit of HTML which
        developers could make use of if they so chose to. The result of using
        this proprietary switch is shown below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/side-by-side.jpg" alt=
        "Variety in iOS's Safari on the left, and variety as an installed app on the right">
        <figcaption>
          A side-by-side comparison of <cite>Variety</cite>'s web application
          running in Safari next to the same application once added to the
          homescreen, on the left and right respectively. Variety's web
          application makes use of Apple's proprietary switch so to make sure
          that once it's launched from iOS's homescreen the application
          integrates with the OS. As seen on the right, this means that browser
          chrome, including the navigation buttons, ability to bookmark, and
          the URL and search bar, have all been removed by iOS.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Windows 8 also provides similar capabilities, but in two different
        forms: one allows a user to "Add site to Apps", meaning that a shortcut
        icon to a web application is added amongst natively installed
        applications. This is shown below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/add_to_apps.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          In Windows 8, "adding a site to apps" makes a website appear amongst
          other apps. Once added, the launch icon is treated identically from
          other applications. Once clicked, the web application is opened in
          Internet Explorer.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The second type of bookmarking supported by Internet Explorer is
        pinning: this adds the site as a "live tile" to the homescreen. To best
        support this functionality, the developer needs to include some
        proprietary metadata for the icons and for how often the tile should be
        updated. The site is not actually presented in the live tile, but an
        RSS feed is used instead.
      </p>

          feed, and not from the HTML of the site itself.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/pin_wp.png" alt="Windows Phone Pin to Start">
        <figcaption>
          Windows Phone 8 comes with the "Pin to Start" feature as well,
          however, the mobile version only displays a static thumbnail of the
          web site, and the metadata for the "live tile" is not available.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        What initially started as a way to add a link to the homescreen has
        incrementally evolved to diminish the functional differences between a
        web application and a native application. This has not happened on the
        OS level alone: progress on the web platform, such as the ability to
        make content available off-line, performance gains through hardware
        acceleration, and <a href=
        "http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/html5forms/">integration
        with native form controls</a>, has assisted in diminishing these
        differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it should be noted that being able to have bookmarks outside the
        web browser is not something particularly new or noble. Desktop
        browsers have had that capability for possibly over a decade. However,
        giving developers the choice to tightly integrate their web
        applications into the OS directly from the Web browser is still
        somewhat new (hence all the proprietary switches and fragmentation in
        this space). This is different from packaged applications (zipped-up
        HTML applications) or hybrid application (applications that are
        distributed as native applications, but rely on a Webview), in that
        they applications are "installed" directly from the browser itself
        rather than from an app store.

          Key components of the "standalone" web application
        </h3>
        <p>
          Web Applications that opt-into being run standalone have somewhat
          different requirements to web applications a user has bookmarked to
          the homescreen. This is because OS level facilities of interacting
          with and controlling native applications are different from those of
          a web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for a web application to be "installed" in such a way that
          it provides a user experience that is indistinguishable from that of
          a native application, a number of key things are needed. This list
          compliments the list of things needed for bookmarking:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Standalone switch:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            If a developer feels that their web application is analogous to a
            native application (e.g., it works offline, doesn't need a
            navigation bar, etc.), then they use some kind of switch (e.g.,
            through markup) to indicate this to the OS when the application is
            added to the homescreen. Otherwise, the installed web application
            is treated as a regular bookmark and launched in the appropriate
            browser.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Name:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The ability for a user to find an application through its name.
            Some OSs allow native applications to be found by using multiple
            names.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Icons:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Generally a small graphic that functions as an application's unique
            visual identifier amongst a list of installed applications. An
            application's icon can also be used in other contexts such a
            settings screen, dialogs, notifications and other menus. Because of
            the various contexts that a application's icon can appear in an OS,
            applications typically need to provide a range of icons at
            different sizes and, more recently, specifically targeted at
            different device pixel densities.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Orientation:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Applications, such as games, require that they be started in a
            particular orientation to function effectively.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Self awareness:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The application is aware through script that it was launched
            "standalone", rather than in the context of a Web browser. This
            differs from native applications, which always run stand alone.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Start page:

            Privacy:

            In web browsers, user's are generally able to control privacy
            settings for a particular website through "site preferences" or
            through the browser's settings. When a web application is taken out
            of the browser context, it needs to either integrate with the
            privacy settings at the OS level or some other intermidiary
            application needs to provide this capability.

            together provide the capabilities of the application. Users
            generally navigate around different panes depending on what they
            are trying to achieve. Web applications, on the othe hand,
            generally rely on hyperlinking from one document to another.

        Indication that the application can work standalone
      </h2>
      <p>
        As already discussed, web applications can be added to the homescreen
        of a device in such a manner that they behave just like bookmarks. That
        is, once added to the homescreen, when the icon of the web application
        is activated, a web browser is launched and the desired web page is
        loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, through various proprietary opt-in mechanisms, developers are
        able to inform the browser that the application is able to work
        "standalone": that is, it is able to function without the user
        interface chrome of a browser - which typically means an web
        application will be launched in full screen. Depending on the OS and
        browser, these opt-in mechanisms can have various side-effects. One
        such web application, <a href="http://forecase.io">Forecast.io</a>, is
        shown below running in iOS.

        <p>
          In iOS, then means by which an application developer indicates that
          their application can be run "standalone" is by using a meta element
          that takes the following form:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          By declaring the above in a document, iOS will launch an application
          that has been added to the home page in fullscreen (without any
          browser chrome).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the meta tag is omitted, and a user adds a page to the home
          screen, then the web application simply opens in a tab within Safari.

          TODO: Discuss that a side effect is the following practice, which can
          range from the annoying to the just bad and requires browser sniffing
          (so you know where to point the "add to home screen" arrow, which is
          different on every browser). Having an API might help with this
          problem, but allowing developers to be a bit more descrete about
          adding to homescreen.

      <h2>
        Icons
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://whatwg.org/c">Web platform</a> provides two
        standardized means to associate icons with a Web application: one being
        the <code>link</code> element with the <code>icon</code> link
        relationship, and two being the <code>favicon.ico</code> - which is a
        graphical resource that a developer places at the root of a site, and
        which user agents will automatically attempt to fetch after a document
        has loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, despite the above two standardized solutions being part
        of the platform since at least 2008, support for the above is lacking
        and so various proprietary solutions have emerged and continue to
        proliferate. This is particularly the case for user agents that support
        adding applications to the home screen of a device. For example:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          iOS:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          For "add to home screen", does not support either of the two standard
          solutions. Instead, iOS relies on <code>link</code> elements whose
          relationship is "<code>apple-touch-icon</code>". It also
          automatically searches the root of a website for specially named
          files (e.g., "apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png").
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Android - Chrome Beta:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Will use iOS's "<span class=
          "example highlight"><code>apple-touch-icon</code>" links if it
          encounters them in a HTML document, but it will not automatically
          scan the root of a site for those icons.</span>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Windows 8:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          For "pinned sites", Windows 8 relies on proprietarily-named
          <code>meta</code> elements described below. <span class=
          "example highlight">Like with iOS, when a site is pinned, it also
          automatically scans the root of a site for specifically named files
          to use as icons.</span>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <section>
        <h3>
          The <code>icon</code> link relationship
        </h3>
        <p>
          To associate an icon with a web application, HTML recommends using a
          <code>link</code> element whose link relationship is
          "<code>icon</code>". For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;link rel="icon" sizes="196x196" href="icon"&gt; 
</pre>
        <p>
          As stated in the [[!HTML] specification:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <q>Icons could be auditory icons, visual icons, or other kinds of
          icons. If multiple icons are provided, the user agent must select the
          most appropriate icon according to the type, media, and sizes
          attributes. If there are multiple equally appropriate icons, user
          agents must use the last one declared in tree order at the time that
          the user agent collected the list of icons. If the user agent tries
          to use an icon but that icon is determined, upon closer examination,
          to in fact be inappropriate (e.g. because it uses an unsupported
          format), then the user agent must try the next-most-appropriate icon
          as determined by the attributes.</q>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Allowing user agents to discriminate depending on media type, media
          query, and size potentially provides a complete responsive solution
          for icons: in that the user agent can use these data points to select
          the most appropriate icon for a particular context (see the <a href=
          "http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/">use cases for responsive
          images</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite what the [[!HTML]] specification recommends, support for
          discriminating on media, sizes, and type is limited: Given a set of
          icons, Gecko-based user agents will use the last known good icon (as
          per the [[HTML]] spec). However, no attempt is made to discriminate
          on size (via the link element's <code>sizes</code> attribute).
          Additionally, Firefox for Android stylizes the icon when a web
          application is added to the home screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Support in Mac OS's Safari is also spotty: given multiple icon
          choices, where the last is unavailable, Safari does not attempt to do
          any error recovery to find alternative icons. In addition, on iOS,
          link <code>rel=icon</code> is not used for "add to homescreen" either
          - only the proprietary "apple-touch-icon" solution is supported
          (discussed below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furtunately, &lt;<code>link rel=icon</code>&gt; is fairly well
          supported on Chrome on both desktop and on iOS and Android, as is
          support in Windows 8: in the aformentioned user agents, the browser
          follows the [[HTML]] specification and select appropriate icons based
          on the sizes attribute. Both browsers also support error handling.
          Unfortunately, in Chrome Beta, when adding to home screen Chromestill
          selects the last icon in set, instead of discriminating on size -
          this can lead to the wrong icon being selected for the available icon
          size of the home screen.

          Favicons are small graphical icons commonly used by web browsers to
          help user's identify a site in the browser's user interface. They
          typically appear on tabs, in bookmark lists, and when viewing a
          browser's history. As favicons were a Microsoft creation, the
          proprietary <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_%28file_format%29">ICO file
          format</a> is a common format used for them. However, browsers are
          not restricted to the .ICO format, and all typical file formats used
          on the Web are supported (i.e., JPEG, PNG, and GIF).

          A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">comprehensive
          history of favicons</a> can be found on Wikipedia, as well as a

          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_%28file_format%29">ICO file
          format</a>. Relevant to this document is the level of
          interoperability of favicons in the platform: all user agents support
          favicons both through using a link relationship and by a developer
          placing a resource called "favicon.ico" at the root of a web site
          (i.e., at "/favicon.ico").

          "Favicon at different sizes">
          <figcaption>
            Because of a constraint in the ICO file format, favicons are
            limited to dimensions of 256 x 256 pixels (though icons are not
            required to be square). However, they can hold any range of icons
            below those sizes. This limitations make favicons unsuitable for
            context that require very large icons, but makes them suitable for
            most contexts in which icons appear in current OSs.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          When an application is added to the home screen of a device, and in
          the absence of dedicated proprietary icon declarations within a
          document, all user agents tested except iOS make use of favicons.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Gecko will only ever use the smallest icon in a set of
          favicons. Chrome and IE will most of the time select an approprietely
          sized icon for the context in which the icon is to be displayed.

          iOS - Touch icons
        </h3>
        <p>
          In iOS, Apple provides a proprietary declarative solution for
          including icons in a HTML document - known as "touch icons". Apple
          iOS has supported touch icons since iOS 1.1.3 and other browsers,
          such as Chrome on Android, will also make use of these icons as a
          fallback when they are available.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
    &lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png"&gt;
          
</pre>
        <p>
          On iOS, when a web page doesn't specify a custom touch icon, the OS
          takes a screenshot of the webstie and creates an icon from it. This
          is shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/ios_icon_screenshot.png" width="320" height="212"
          alt="adding to homescreen without a touch icon">
        </figure>
        <p>
          When an application is bookmarked, iOS automatically adds some visual
          effects to an icon so that it integrates more effectivly with the
          built-in icons on the home screen (as it does with application
          icons). Specifically, iOS adds:
        </p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
          As of iOS 2.0, a developer can prevent the addition of these effects
          by using the precomposed keyword:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png"&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          If no icons are specified in the HTML, iOS Safari will search the
          website’s root directory for icons with the apple-touch-icon or
          apple-touch-icon-precomposed prefix. For example, if the appropriate
          icon size for the device is 57 × 57 pixels, iOS searches for
          filenames in the following order:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
          </li>
          <li>apple-touch-icon-57x57.png
          </li>
          <li>apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
          </li>
          <li>apple-touch-icon.png
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, for iOS, it’s not necessary to use HTML to add touch icons to a
          site, even if one wants to use multiple resolution-specific icons.
          This helps avoid having to use proprietary <code>&lt;link
          rel="apple-touch-icon"&gt;</code> elements on every single HTML page.
          A developer just needs to create different versions of the icon, use
          the correct file names and place them in the root of the website.

          Android has a default system provided icon, and, as already mention,
          it will fall back to using a favicon if it’s available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Android is able to fallback to using the iOS icons, the
          no-HTML approach doesn’t work on the Android browser (tested in 2.3
          Gingerbread, 3 Honeycomb, 4.1 Jelly Bean), although there is
          anectodotal evidence <a href=

          logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like iOS, when the proprietary declarations are missing, Windows will
          also search the root of a website for specifically named files that
          follow the afformentioned file name pattern. If no suitabile icons

        Security and privacy
      </h2>
      <p>
        The act of adding an application to the home screen serves as a cue to
        alter the security policy of an application. For example, in iOS, and
        application that has been added to the home screen will no longer share
        cookies, localStorage, IDB, etc. with the Safari Web browser. The OS
        will also reset all its API permissions, so, for example, any
        previously granted permission to access location services that occurred
        in the browser are forgotten once the application is added to the
        homescreen - the end-user will need to re-enable such permission again
        after the application is launched from the homescreen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, by adding the application to the home screen, the
        application gains its own independent privacy settings in iOS's privacy
        menus. This is shown in the figure below.

        Orientation
      </h2>
      <p>
        An application's orientation can be unlocked, meaning that the layout
        of the application can adapt to portrait or landscape, or can be locked
        to either portrait, landscape. Portrait or landscape can be further
        constrained to being flippable or not. Flippable means that if the
        device is rotated 180 degrees, the display is also flipped. Otherwise,
        the orientation remains locked.
      </p>
      <p>
        A developer may also want to lock to a different orientation depending
        on the class of the device, the size of the screen, or the aspect ratio
        of the screen used. For example, use portrait on a phone and landscape
        on a tablet. For example, BBC iPlayer does this (on iOS?).

        Navigation
      </h2>
      <p>
        The ability to navigate documents by activating hyperlinks is a
        fundamental aspect of the Web platform. It's what makes the web, the
        web. However, when applications are added to the homescreen of a
        device, and indicate that they are able to function standalone, the
        navigational behavior has some side effects. These side effects
        generally emerge because the applications are launched in full screen
        and devoid of any browser chrome, and so the are no visual indicators
        for the user to get a sense of where they are (as they normally would
        with an address bar). As such, different browsers deals with this
        problem in different ways.

        <p>
          Chrome allows users to freely navigate web documents by following
          hyperlinks: this works both same origin and across origins. However,
          if a user navigates away from the origin from which the application
          was installed, a small bar with the new origin to be shown. This
          appears to be done as a security precaution to give the user a better
          sense of where they are (specially if they have unexpectedly been
          navigated to another domain).

          iOS7 Safari
        </h3>
        <p>
          On iOS, once an application is added to the homescreen,
          hyperlink-based navigation from one document to another is no longer
          possible by default: this is because in iOS, the "default behavior"
          of activating a link is to open the link in Safari (note however,
          navigating within the document itself via fragment identifiers is
          still possible). The default behavior can be prevented by capturing
          all click events generated by HTML <code>a</code> elements. Once an
          event has been captured, and prevented from performing the default
          action, then the <code>window.location</code> can be manually set by
          script. Preventing the default behavior and manually handling the
          navigation is illustrated by the code below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
document.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  var elem = e.target;
  if (elem.tagName &amp;&amp; elem.tagName === "A") {
    e.preventDefault();
    location.href = elem.href;
  }
});
</pre>
        <p>
          Once click events are captured and the default behavior prevented, it
          becomes possible not only to navigate a document within the same
          origin, but also to other origins. However, every document will need
          to include code similar to the one above in order for navigation via
          hyperlinks to continue to work.

      </h2>
      <p>
        A standardized solution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MUST provide a mechanism that allows a developer to indicate that
        the application is able to function as standalone. If no such
        indication is given by the developer, then the application MUST launch
        in the Web browser as normal. That is, the solution MUST NOT conflate
        bookmarking with allowing a web application to be launched as
        standalone.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a mechanism for the application to check (e.g., via
        script) if it's running as a standalone application.
        </li>
        <li>MAY provide a mechanism for the developer to interrogate the
        browser about what UI chrome is available (e.g., is there a navigation
        bar?).
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to include a name for the web application.
        This name is not the same as the document's title, though the document
        title could serve as the name if the name is missing.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD provide a means to support a short name for the application.
        </li>
        <li>MAY provide a means to delcare application names in multiple
        languages.
        </li>
        <li>MUST specify the default navigation behavior for a standalone
        application.
        </li>
        <li>MUST clarify the security model with regards to how permissions and
        data are shared with the web browser from which the web application was
        bookmarked or installed. This could possibly allow the developer to
        opt-into (or out of) sharing cookies, storage data, etc. with the
        browser that installed the application.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to declare multiple iconic representations
        suitable for a range of contexts. In addition, the solution SHOULD
        allow developers to declare the dimensions, format, as well as a means
        to indicate the preferred device-pixel-ratio at which each icon should
        be used.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to declare the orientation that the
        application needs to be in when launched. The solution MUST allow the
        application to fully lock to a particular orientation, or allow a
        soft-lock to a particular orientation: meaning that if the user flips
        the device 180 degrees, the document is also flipped.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means that allows the developer to declare the URL
        that will be opened when the application is launched. This URL
        overrides the URL from which the document was added to the homescreen.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD standardize an API for adding web applications to the
        homescreen.
