        This document provides a historical over view of how web applications
        have started to be integrated into native application environments, and
        outlines the use cases and requirements for a standard that could allow
        users to "install" web applications. The use cases and requirements
        were gathered by examining the landscape of proprietary solutions, and,
        where possible, by gathering statistics about the prevalence and usage
        patterns of particular solutions used in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proprietary solutions that integrate web applications into the
        underlying operating system have been used in the wild for a few years
        now, so consolidation towards a standardized solution could potentially
        benefit users, developers, and browser vendors.

        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        To launch native applications on either a desktop-class machine or a
        mobile device, users are generally presented with icons and
        corresponding labels that represent the applications installed on their
        system. Having the icons of web applications appear amongst
        applications that the user considers native (e.g., those on the home
        screen of a device) gives the perception to users that a web
        application has been "installed" - even if the processes that go into
        actually "installing" a web application differ from those of a native
        application.
      </p>

          Mavericks.

      </figure>
      <p>
        At the time of writing, the web platform lacks a standardized means for
        a web application to indicate that it can be "installed" and treated as
        if it were an native application. As this document will show, the web
        platform also lacks sufficient metadata for a Web application to be
        successfully integrated into an operating system in the same way native
        applications are (i.e., not just on the homescreen, but integration
        into other contexts such as the task switcher, privacy and security
        settings, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this gap in the web platform, browser vendors, including
        Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, have implemented proprietary
        solutions that allow users to add web applications to the homescreen.
        To get a web application to more fully integrate with the OS,
        developers are sometimes required to use proprietary opt-in mechanisms,
        which are discussed later, to indicate to the browser that the web
        application can potentially work as a stand-alone application once it's
        added to the homescreen. These opt-in mechanisms primarily provide the
        OS with metadata (e.g., the icons and name of the application) so when
        the web application is added to the homescreen, it appears
        indistinguishable from an application that was natively installed.

      <h2>
        Bookmarking
      </h2>
      <p>
        To access a web application, users traditionally opened up a web
        browser, typed a URL or a search query into a search box, and had the
        browser navigate to the web application they wanted. Alternatively, a
        user may have "bookmarked" within a Web browser a set of web documents
        or web applications they commonly access.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, browsers have started to monitor user's browsing habits
        to intelligently deduce which are the most common web sites the user
        likes to visit (i.e., a type of automatic bookmarking). The browser
        will then present visual links to those sites. Depending on the
        browser, user-defined and automatically-gleaned bookmarks will appear
        as a list of document titles or file names in either a drop-down menu,
        "speed-dial" cells, a toolbar, and/or a dedicated application window or
        tab. All these bookmark types are illustrated below.
      </p>
      <figure>

          <p>
            In a desktop-based browser, there are at least six different ways
            to access bookmarks. Some of those bookmarks are derived
            dynamically by monitoring user's browsing habits, such as the most
            visited sites and "speed dial" entries the user sees when they open
            a new tab.

          Bookmarking on mobile browsers
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile devices, the interaction model has traditionally been the
          same as the one described above: there has historically been a clear
          distinction between opening a native application and accessing a web
          application. That is, to access a Web application a user needs to
          first locate the Web browser they want to use, launch it, and then
          either type-in a URL or select a bookmark. Web browsers on mobile
          operating systems have thus added similar bookmarking facilities as
          those found in desktop-class browsers. This is shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mobile_bookmarks.jpg" alt=
          "From left to right, the bookmarking facilities of Safari on iOS, Android 4.3 stock browser, Chrome on iOS, and Firefox OS's default browser.">
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers closely resemble
              those of desktop-browsers - providing both a traditional list of
              bookmarks as well as a "speed dial" that can contain either
              automatically gleaned bookmarks or user-configured ones.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Having bookmarking facilities in mobile browsers helps reduce some of
          the burden associated with having to type URLs. Particularly for
          sites that the user visits regularly, it means that a web site can be
          accessed by a single press. Additionally, bookmarking facilities help
          separate locally installed applications from web sites the user needs
          to access for other reasons (e.g., a particular wiki page on an
          intranet, a document with commonly required information, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table shows some examples of how a user bookmarks a
          page on a mobile browser. Both iOS and Android provide the user with
          the ability to customize the name of the bookmark, as well as
          organize the bookmark bu placing it into a particular location.
          Firefox OS, however, simply let's the use "star" a page - this gives
          the user the option to bookmark the page. Once bookmarked, the site
          is added to a bookmarks tab (not shown below), which, unlike other
          mobile browsers, does not provide a means to manipulate the metadata
          of the bookmark.

        <h3>
          Limitations of bookmarking: multiple home screens
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because bookmarks contain links to a range of different types of
          resources, the bookmarking facilities of desktop and mobile browsers
          do not integrate into an operating system's application menu. This
          means that web applications and "native" applications are treated as
          different things. This separation makes sense for many kinds of web
          sites (e.g., static, informational websites that provide little other
          functionality), but there is a range of applications that can provide
          an experience that is analogous to that provided by an application
          installed locally on a user's device (e.g., a game, an office
          productivity suite, a news or social networking site, a currency
          converter or photo manipulation utility, etc.). That said, it is
          users who are in the best position to decide what they consider an
          "app" and where they would like to access it from (either as a
          bookmark or as one of their locally installed application).
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below, this desire to treat websites as applications has led
          at least one browser maker to attempt to replicate the homescreen
          experience directly in the browser itself.
        </p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>
            In iOS 7's Safari web browser, the default tab view presents icons
            derived from websites to create what is, in effect, a second
            homescreen - image on the left. This can be clearly seen when
            contrasted with the actual iOS 7 homescreen -image on the right.
            Google Chrome's browser, although not shown here, does the same
            thing in iOS: it presents bookmarked pages as a grid of icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this is a convenient way to access web sites, there are web
          applications that would benefit users if they could be directly
          available from the primary home screen. Also relegating web
          applications to this second homescreen means that web applications
          are treated as "second-class citizens": in the sense that in order to
          access these applications, a user must first launch the correct
          browser (from potentially a range of different browsers), and then
          press the icon for the application they wish to load.

      <h2>
        Add to homescreen
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, web applications should be immediately available to users
        without them needing to launch a separate application (a web browser)
        and having to type a URL. A user may have found a web application
        through browsing the web (e.g., through a search engine or through a
        website that works as an "app store"), but once added to the
        homescreen, the developer needs to be able to control if in web
        application opens in a Web browser environmnet or if the application is
        launched <dfn>standalone</dfn>: that is, once the application is
        launched, it appears indistinguishable from a native application by
        allowing the OS to treat it as equivelent to a native application. This
        includes, but is not limited to, integration with OS facilities such as
        the task switcher and doing away with browser UI chrome (the address
        bar, forward/back buttons, etc.) - so the application appears to run in
        full-screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser makers have long acknowledged this as something developers want
        and that users could benefit from: iOS's Safari has had the capability
        to add a website to the homescreen since early 2008 (as of version
        1.1.3, as shown in the figure below); the Android's stock browser has
        provided the capability to "add to homescreen" since at least 2009 -
        though the process of adding to website to the homescreen was
        significantly more convoluted.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/early_addtohomescreen.jpg" alt="iOS 1.1.3">
        <figcaption>
          iOS's Safari has almost always provided a way for users to add
          websites to the home screen of the device. Once the use presses
          "add", the icon for the Web application is placed along side other
          native application icons.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The ability to add a web site to the homescreen didn't automatically
        make a web application look, feel, or integrate into the operating
        system in the same way as native applications did. For instance,
        originally in iOS, launching a web application that had been added to
        the homescreen took the user back into Safari; in other words, it
        worked just like a traditional bookmark. It was only with the release
        of iOS 2.2 in September 2008 that applications that had been added to
        the home screen gained the capability to be displayed full screen
        (i.e., doing away with Safari's application chrome, as shown below).
        Apple did this by introducing a proprietary bit of HTML which
        developers could make use of. The result of using this proprietary
        switch is shown below.

        It must be noted that being able to have bookmarks outside the web
        browser is not something particuarly new or nobel. Desktop browsers
        have had this capability for possibly over a decade.

          From fancy bookmark to installed webapp
        </h3>
        <p>
          What initially started as a way to simply add a link to a website
          from iOS's homescreen has incrementally evolved to diminish the
          functional differences between a web application and a native
          application. This has not happened on the OS level alone: progress on
          the web platform, such as the ability to make content available
          off-line, performance gains through hardware acceleration, and
          integration with native form controls, has assisted in diminishing
          these differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, tighter integration between web applications and the
          underlying operating system has meant that applications that are
          added to the homescreen behave differently to those accessed directly
          through a web browser. There are also areas where native applications
          remain distinct, by having capabilities that are not accessible to
          installed web applications.

          Key components of the installed application experience
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order for a web application to be "installed" in such a way that
          it provides a user experience that is indistinguishable from that of
          a native application, a number of key things are needed:

            Name(s):
          </dt>

            Some OSs allow native applications to be found by using multiple
            names. Web applications, because of HTML's origin as a
            document-publishing format, have a "title" and these titles are
            applied "per page" basis using HTML's &lt;title&gt; element.

            various contexts (primarily, an icon that functions as an
            application's unique identifier amongst a list of installed
            applications), but also in other contexts - such as settings
            screen. Because of the various contexts that a native application's
            icon can appear in an OS, native applications typically need to
            provide a large range of icons at different sizes and, more
            recently, specifically targeted at different device pixel
            densities.

            It also refers to what happens when a user clicks on a link that
            would take user to another domain.

        When users add a web application to the home screen and the web
        application is launched, the OS can automatically integrate the web
        application into facilities like the task switcher. As can be seen in
        the figure below, this makes the distinction between a native
        application and a web application negligible from an OS-integration
        perspective.

          Indication that the application can work standalone
        </h2>
        <p>
          As already discussed, web applications can be added to the homescreen
          of a device in such a manner that they behave just like bookmarks.
          That is, once added to the homescreen, when the icon of the web
          application is activated, a web browser is launched and the desired
          web page is loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, through various proprietary opt-in mechanisms, developers
          are able to inform the browser that the application is able to work
          "stand alone": that is, it is able to function without the user
          interface chrome of a browser - which typically means an web
          application will be launched in full screen. Depending on the OS and
          browser, these opt-in mechanisms can have various side-effects.

          <p>
            In iOS, then means by which an application developer indicates that
            their application can be run "standalone" is by using a meta
            element that takes the following form:
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;
</pre>
          <p>
            By declaring the above in a document, iOS will launch an

            (without any browser chrome).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the meta tag is omitted, and a user adds a page to the home
            screen, then the web application simply it opens in a tab within

            Firefox OS lacks a way to declaratively indicate to the Web browser
            that the application can run standalone when lunched. Instead,
            Firefox OS relies on an API to provide this functionality. The
            <code>mozApps.install()</code> method takes a url to a JSON file as
            an argument. The JSON file supplies Firefox OS with the relevant
            metadata (e.g., application's name, URLs for the icons, etc.)
            needed to make installation possible.

        Names
      </h2>
      <p>
        Native applications can have multiple names. Because of this, you can
        find them in multiple ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web applications get their names from the &lt;title&gt;. This is
        annoying. It means constantly having to fix the name when you add to
        home screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML5 provides a solution, "application-name":
      </p>
      <pre class="highlight">
&lt;head&gt;
  ... 
  &lt;meta name="application-name" content="Awesome App!"&gt; 
  ... 
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
      <p>
        HTML5 limits this to 1 name:
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The value must be a short free-form string giving the name of the Web
          application that the page represents. If the page is not a Web
          application, the application-name metadata name must not be used.
          There must not be more than one meta element with its name attribute
          set to the value application-name per document. User agents may use
          the application name in UI in preference to the page's title, since
          the title might include status messages and the like relevant to the
          status of the page at a particular moment in time instead of just
          being the name of the application.

        Icons

      <p>
        Native applications have lots of icons. iOS uses xxx many. Android
        needs yyy many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web applications have traditionally only used 1 (favicon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Icons on native platforms need to be designed for multiple densities -
        not just resolutions.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Security and privacy
      </h2>
      <p>
        The act of adding an application to the home screen serves as a cue to
        alter the security policy of an application. For example, in iOS, and
        application that has been added to the home screen will no longer share
        cookies, localStorage, IDB, etc. with the Safari Web browser. The OS
        will also reset all its API permissions, so, for example, any
        previously granted permission to access location services that occurred
        in the browser are forgotten once the application is added to the
        homescreen - the end-user will need to re-enable such permission again
        after the application is launched from the homescreen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, by adding the application to the home screen, the
        application gains its own independent privacy settings in iOS's privacy
        menus. This is shown in the figure below.

        An application's orientation can be unlocked, meaning that the layout
        of the application can adapt to portrait or landscape, or can be locked
        to either portrait, landscape. Portrait or landscape can be further
        constrained to being flippable or not. Flippable means that if the
        device is rotated 180 degrees, the display is also flipped. Otherwise,
        the orientation remains locked.

        Navigation
      </h2>
      <p>
        The ability to navigate documents by activating hyperlinks is a
        fundamental aspect of the Web platform. It's what makes the web, the
        web. However, when applications are added to the homescreen of a
        device, and indicate that they are able to function standalone, the
        navigational behavior has some side effects. These side effects
        generally emerge because the applications are launched in full screen
        and devoid of any browser chrome, and so the are no visual indicators
        for the user to get a sense of where they are (as they normally would
        with an address bar). As such, different browsers deals with this
        problem in different ways.

          Android - Chrome beta

        <p>
          Chrome allows users to freely navigate web documents by following
          hyperlinks: this works both same origin and across origins. However,
          if a user navigates away from the origin from which the application
          was installed, a small bar with the new origin to be shown. This
          appears to be done as a security precaution to give the user a better
          sense of where they are (specially if they have unexpectedly been
          navigated to another domain).

          iOS7 Safari
        </h3>
        <p>
          On iOS, once an application is added to the homescreen,
          hyperlink-based navigation from one document to another is no longer
          possible by default: this is because in iOS, the "default behavior"
          of activating a link is to open the link in Safari (note however,
          navigating within the document itself via fragment identifiers is
          still possible). The default behavior can be prevented by capturing
          all click events generated by HTML <code>a</code> elements. Once an
          event has been captured, and prevented from performing the default
          action, then the <code>window.location</code> can be manually set by
          script. Preventing the default behavior and manually handling the
          navigation is illustrated by the code below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
document.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  var elem = e.target;
  if (elem.tagName &amp;&amp; elem.tagName === "A") {
    e.preventDefault();
    location.href = elem.href;
  }
});
</pre>
        <p>
          Once click events are captured and the default behavior prevented, it
          becomes possible not only to navigate a document within the same
          origin, but also to other origins. However, every document will need
          to include code similar to the one above in order for navigation via
          hyperlinks to continue to work.
