        This document outlines the use cases and requirements that would allow
        users to "install" web applications. The use cases and requirements
        were gathered by examining the landscape of proprietary solutions, and,
        where possible, by gathering statistics about the prevalence and usage
        patterns of particular solutions used in the wild. Proprietary
        solutions that integrate web applications into the underlying operating
        system have been used "in the wild" for a few years now, so
        consolidation towards a standardized solution could potentially benefit
        users, developers, and browser vendors.

        Towards installable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        To launch native applications on either a desktop-class machine or a
        mobile device, users are generally presented with icons and
        corresponding labels that represent the applications installed on their
        system.

        <p>
          Conversely, to access a web application, users traditionally opened
          up a web browser, typed a URL or a search query into a search box,
          and had the browser navigate to the web application they wanted.
          Alternatively, a user may have "bookmarked" within a Web browser a
          set of web documents or web applications they commonly access.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, browsers have started to monitor user's browsing
          habits to intelligently deduce which are the most common web sites
          the user likes to visit (i.e., a type of automatic bookmarking). The
          browser will then present visual links to those sites. Depending on
          the browser, user-defined and automatically-gleaned bookmarks will
          appear as a list of document titles or file names in either a
          drop-down menu, "speed-dial" cells, a toolbar, and/or a dedicated
          application window or tab. All these bookmark types are illustrated
          below.

            <p>
              There are at least six different ways to access bookmarks in a
              desktop-based browser. Some of those bookmarks are derived
              dynamically by monitoring user's browsing habits, such as the
              most visited sites and "speed dial" entries the user sees when
              they open a new tab.

        <h3>
          Bookmarking on mobile browsers
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile devices, the interaction model has traditionally been the
          same as the one described above: there has historically been a clear
          distinction between opening a native application and accessing a Web
          application. That is, the user needs to first locate the Web browser
          they want to use, launch it, and then either type-in a URL or use a
          bookmark to access a Web application. Web browsers that run on mobile
          operating systems have thus had to add similar bookmarking facilities
          as those found in desktop-class browsers, as shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mobile_bookmarks.jpg" alt=
          "From left to right, the bookmarking facilities of Safari on iOS, Android 4.3 stock browser, Chrome on iOS, and Firefox OS's default browser.">
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers closely resemble
              those of desktop-browsers - providing both a traditional list of
              bookmarks as well as a "speed dial" that can contain either
              automatically gleaned bookmarks or user-configured ones.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Having bookmarking facilities in mobile browsers helps reduce some of
          the burden associated with having to type URLs. Particularly for
          sites that the user visits regularly, it means that a web site can be
          accessed by a single press.

        <h3>
          Limitations of bookmarking: multiple home screens
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the bookmarking facilities of desktop and mobile
          browsers do not integrate into an operating system's application
          menu. This means that web applications and "native" applications are
          treated as different things. This separation might make sense for
          many kinds of web sites (e.g., static, informational ones that
          provide little other ), but there is a range of applications that can
          provide an experience that is analogous to that provided by an
          application installed locally on the user's device (e.g., a game, an
          office productivity suite, a currency converter or similar utility,
          etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below, this has led at least one browser to attempt to
          replicate the homescreen experience directly in the browser itself.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/ios_default_tab.png" alt=""> <img src=
          "images/iOS_homescreen.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>
            In iOS 7's Safari web browser, the default tab view presents icons
            derived from websites to create what is, in effect, a second
            homescreen - image on the left. This can be clearly seen when
            contrasted with the actual iOS 7 homescreen -image on the right.
            Google Chrome's browser, although not shown here, does the same
            thing in iOS: it presents bookmarked pages as a grid of icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this is a convenient way to access web sites, there are web
          applications that would benefit from being directly available from
          the primary home screen. Also relegating web applications to this
          second homescreen means that web applications are treated as
          "second-class citizens": in the sense that in order to access these
          applications, a user must first launch the right browser (from
          potentially a range of different browsers), and then press the icon
          for the application they wish to load.

      <h2>
        Add to homescreen
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, web applications should be immediately available to users,
        without them needing to launch a separate application (a web browser)
        and having to type a URL. And application may be found through browsing
        the web, but once "installed", it should be functionally
        indistinguishable from a native application. Browser makers have long
        acknowledged this as something users would want: iOS's Safari has had
        the capability to add a website to the homescreen since early 2008
        (version 1.1.3, shown in the figure below); Android's stock browser has
        provided the capability to "add to homescreen" since at least 2009
        (though the process of adding to website to the homescreen was
        significantly more convoluted).
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/early_addtohomescreen.jpg" alt="iOS 1.1.3">
        <figcaption>
          The ability to add a web site to the homescreen didn't automatically
          make a web application look, feel, or integrate into the operating
          system in the same way as native applications did. For instance,
          originally in iOS, launching a web application that had been added to
          the homescreen took the user back into Safari. It was only with the
          release of iOS 2.2 in September 2008 that applications that had been
          added to the home screen gained the capability to be displayed full
          screen (doing away with Safari's chrome).

      <h3>
        From fancy bookmark to installed webapp
      </h3>
      <p>
        What initially started as a way to simply add a link to a website from
        iOS's homescreen has incrementally evolved to diminish the functional
        differences between a web application and a native application. This
        has not happened on the OS level alone; progress on the web platform,
        such as the ability to make content available offiline and native
        intergration of form inputs, has assisted in diminishing these
        differences. However, tighter integration between web applications and
        the underlying operating system has meant that applications that are
        added to the homescreen behave differently to those accessed directly
        through the web browser. There are also areas where native applications
        remain distinct, by having capabilities that are not accessible to
        installed web applications. These areas are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Naming:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The ability for a user to find an application through its name(s).
          Some OSs allow native applications to be found by using multiple
          names. Web applications, because of HTML's origin as a
          document-publishing format, have a "title" and these titles are
          applied "per page" basis using HTML's &lt;title&gt; element.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Iconography
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The graphical representations that represent the application in
          various contexts (primarily, an icon that functions as an
          application's unique identifier amongst a list of installed
          applications), but also in other contexts - such as settings screen.
          Because of the various contexts that a native application's icon can
          appear in an OS, native applications typically need to provide a
          large range of icons at different sizes and, more recently,
          specifically targetted at different device pixel densities.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Orientation
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Applications, such as games, require that they be started in a
          particular orientation to function effectively. We applications are
          generally designed using responsive web design techniques, which
          means [???]
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Self awareness
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The applications is aware through script that it was launched
          "standalone", rather than in the context of a Web browser. This
          differs from native applications, which always run stand alone.

      <p>
        The web platform still lacks a standardized means for a web application
        to be "installed" and launched as if it were an native application.
        Having the icons of web applications appear amongst applications that
        the user considers native (e.g., those on the home screen of a device)
        gives the perception to users that a web application has been
        "installed" (even if the processes that go into actually "installing" a
        web application differ from those of a native application).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this gap in the web platform, browser vendors, including
        Google, Apple, and Mozilla, have implemented proprietary solutions that
        allow users to add web applications to the homescreen. To achieve this,
        developers use proprietary opt-in mechanisms to indicate to the browser
        that the web application can work as a stand-alone application once
        it's added to the homescreen. These opt-in mechanisms also provide
        metadata (e.g., the icon) that allows applications to add the
        application to the homescreen. Two examples of how a developer entices
        users to add an application to the home screen are shown below.
      </p>

        When users add a web application to the home screen and the web
        application is launched, the OS can automatically integrate the web
        application into facilities like the task switcher. As can be seen in
        the figure below, this makes the distinction between a native
        application and a web application negligible from an OS-integration
        perspective.
      </p>

            The figure shows how the <cite><a href=
            "http://forecase.io">Forecast</a></cite> web application integrates
            with iOS 7's task switcher. Note also the web application's launch
            icon is indistinguishable from those of other applications.

        The act of adding an application to the home screen serves as a cue to
        alter the security policy of an application. For example, in iOS, and
        application that has been added to the home screen will no longer share
        cookies, localStorage, IDB, etc. with Safari. The application will also
        reset all its API permissions, so, for example, any previously granted
        permission to access location services is forgotten once the
        application is added to the homescreen - the end-user will need to
        re-enable such permission again after the application is launched from
        the homescreen. However, by adding the application to the home screen,
        the application gains its own independent privacy settings in iOS's
        system menu. This is shown in the figure below.
