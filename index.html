        This document provides an overview of how web applications have started
        to be integrated into native application environments, and outlines the
        use cases and requirements for a standard that could allow users to
        "install" web applications. The use cases and requirements were
        gathered by examining the landscape of proprietary solutions, and,
        where possible, by gathering statistics about the prevalence and usage
        patterns of particular solutions used in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proprietary solutions that integrate web applications into the
        underlying operating system have been used in the wild for a few years
        now, so consolidation towards a standardized solution could potentially
        benefit users, developers, and browser vendors.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        To launch native applications on either a desktop-class machine or a
        mobile device, users are generally presented with icons and
        corresponding labels that represent the applications installed on their
        system. Having the icons of web applications appear amongst
        applications that the user considers native (e.g., those on the home
        screen of a device) gives the perception to users that a web
        application has been "installed" - even if the processes that go into
        actually "installing" a web application differ from those of a native
        application.

          Mavericks.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        At the time of writing, the web platform lacks a standardized means for
        a web application to indicate that it can be "installed" and treated as
        if it were an native application. As this document will show, the web
        platform also lacks sufficient metadata for a Web application to be
        successfully integrated into an operating system in the same way native
        applications are (i.e., not just on the homescreen, but integration
        into other contexts such as the task switcher, privacy and security
        settings, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this gap in the web platform, browser vendors, including
        Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla, have implemented proprietary
        solutions that allow users to add web applications to the homescreen.
        To get a web application to more fully integrate with the OS,
        developers are sometimes required to use proprietary opt-in mechanisms,
        which we discuss later, to indicate to the browser that the web
        application can potentially work as a stand-alone application once it's
        added to the homescreen. These opt-in mechanisms primarily provide the
        OS with metadata (e.g., the icons and name of the application) so when
        the web application is added to the homescreen, it appears
        indistinguishable from an application that was natively installed.

      <h2>
        Bookmarking
      </h2>
      <p>
        To access a web application, users traditionally opened up a web
        browser, typed a URL or a search query into a search box, and had the
        browser navigate to the web application they wanted. Alternatively, a
        user may have "bookmarked" within a Web browser a set of web documents
        or web applications they commonly access.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, browsers have started to monitor user's browsing habits
        to intelligently deduce which are the most common web sites the user
        likes to visit (i.e., a type of automatic bookmarking). The browser
        will then present visual links to those sites. Depending on the
        browser, user-defined and automatically-gleaned bookmarks will appear
        as a list of document titles or file names in either a drop-down menu,
        "<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Speed_Dial">speed-dial</a>"
        entries, a toolbar, and/or a dedicated application window or tab. All
        these bookmark types are illustrated below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/desktop_bookmarking.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          In a desktop-based browser, there are at least six different ways to
          access bookmarks. Some of those bookmarks are derived dynamically by
          monitoring user's browsing habits, such as the most visited sites and
          "<a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Speed_Dial">speed
          dial</a>" entries the user sees when they open a new tab.

        <h3>
          Bookmarking on mobile browsers
        </h3>
        <p>
          On mobile devices, the interaction model has traditionally been the
          same as the one described above: historically, there's been a clear
          distinction between opening a native application and accessing a web
          application. That is, to access a Web application a user needs to
          first locate the Web browser they want to use, launch it, and then
          either type-in a URL or select a bookmark. Web browsers on mobile
          operating systems have thus added similar bookmarking facilities as
          those found in desktop-class browsers. This is shown below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/mobile_bookmarks.jpg" alt=
          "From left to right, the bookmarking facilities of Safari on iOS, Android 4.3 stock browser, Chrome on iOS, and Firefox OS's default browser.">
          <figcaption>
            The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers closely resemble
            those of desktop-browsers - providing both a traditional list of
            bookmarks as well as a "speed dial" that can contain either
            automatically gleaned bookmarks or user-configured ones.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The bookmarking facilities of mobile browsers helps reduce some of
          the burden of typing URLs. Particularly for sites that the user
          visits regularly, it means that a web site can be accessed by a
          single press. Additionally, bookmarking facilities help separate
          native applications from web sites the user needs to access for other
          reasons (e.g., a particular wiki page on an intranet, a document with
          commonly required information, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table shows some examples of how a user bookmarks a
          page on a mobile browser. Both iOS and Android provide the user with
          the ability to customize the name of the bookmark, as well as
          organize the bookmark by placing it into a particular location.
          Firefox OS, however, simply let's the user "star" a page - this gives
          the user the option to bookmark the page. Once bookmarked, the site
          is added to a bookmarks tab (not shown below), which, unlike other
          mobile browsers, does not provide a means to manipulate the metadata
          of the bookmark.

        <h3>
          Side-effects of bookmarking: multiple home screens
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because basic bookmarks contain links to a range of different types
          of resources, the bookmarking facilities of desktop and mobile
          browsers do not integrate into an operating system's application
          menu. This means that web applications and "native" applications are
          treated as different things. This separation makes sense for many
          kinds of web sites (e.g., static, informational websites that provide
          little other functionality), but there is a range of applications
          that can provide an experience that is analogous to that provided by
          an application installed locally on a user's device (e.g., a game, an
          office productivity suite, a news or social networking site, a
          currency converter or photo manipulation utility, etc.). That said,
          it is users who are in the best position to decide what they consider
          an "app" and where they would like to access it from (either as a
          bookmark or as one of their locally installed applications).
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown below, this desire to treat websites as applications has led
          at least one browser maker to attempt to replicate the homescreen
          experience directly in the browser itself.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/ios_default_tab.png" alt=""> <img src=
          "images/iOS_homescreen.png" alt="">
          <figcaption>
            In iOS 7's Safari web browser, the default tab view presents icons
            derived from websites to create what is, in effect, a second
            homescreen - image on the left. This can be clearly seen when
            contrasted with the actual iOS 7 homescreen -image on the right.
            Google Chrome's browser, although not shown here, does the same
            thing in iOS: it presents bookmarked pages as a grid of icons.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this is a convenient way to access web sites, there are web
          applications that would benefit users if they were directly available
          from where the user normally accesses their installed applications.
          Also relegating web applications to this second homescreen means that
          web applications are treated as "second-class citizens": in the sense
          that in order to access these applications, a user must first launch
          the correct browser (from potentially a range of different browsers),
          and then press the icon for the application they wish to load.

        <h3>
          Key components of bookmarking
        </h3>
        <p>
          From the discussion above, we can conclude that the key bits of
          information that are needed to enable bookmarking are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
            Name (label or title):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Generally this will be the title of the page being bookmarked.
            Mobile browsers usually allow users to change this, specially when
            bookmarking to the homescreen.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Icon:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Generally, the site's favicon. However, proprietary solutions exist
            that allow the browser to select from a range of icons.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            URL:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The URL to be loaded when the user activates the bookmark.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Organization:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Browsers generally provide some facility to allow bookmarks to be
            organized (e.g., into folders).

      <h2>
        Add to homescreen
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, web applications should be immediately available to users
        without them needing to launch a separate application (a web browser)
        and having to type a URL. A user may have found a web application
        through browsing the web (e.g., through a search engine, via a link
        given to them by a friend on a social network, or through a website
        that works as an "app store"), but once added to the homescreen, the
        developer needs to be able to control if in web application opens in a
        Web browser environment or if the application is launched
        <dfn>standalone</dfn>: that is, once the application is launched, it
        appears indistinguishable from a native application by allowing the OS
        to treat it as equivalent to a native application. This includes, but
        is not limited to, integration with OS facilities such as the task
        switcher and doing away with browser UI chrome (the address bar,
        forward/back buttons, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some browser makers have long acknowledged this as something developers
        want and that users could benefit from: iOS's Safari has had the
        capability to add a website to the homescreen since early 2008 (as of
        version 1.1.3, as shown in the figure below); the Android's stock
        browser has provided the capability to "add to homescreen" since at
        least 2009. Windows 8 also provides a similar capability, called
        "pinning", which we discuss in more detail below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/early_addtohomescreen.jpg" alt="iOS 1.1.3">
        <figcaption>
          iOS's Safari has almost always provided a way for users to add
          websites to the home screen of the device. Once the user presses
          "add", the icon for the Web application is placed along side other
          native application icons.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The ability to add a web site to the homescreen didn't automatically
        make a web application look, feel, or integrate into the operating
        system in the same way as native applications did. For instance,
        originally in iOS, launching a web application that had been added to
        the homescreen took the user back into Safari; in other words, it
        worked just like a traditional bookmark. It was only with the release
        of iOS 2.2 in September 2008 that applications that had been added to
        the home screen gained the capability to be displayed full screen
        (i.e., doing away with Safari's application chrome, as shown below).
        Apple did this by introducing a proprietary bit of HTML which
        developers could make use of if they so chose to. The result of using
        this proprietary switch is shown below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/side-by-side.jpg" alt=
        "Variety in iOS's Safari on the left, and variety as an installed app on the right">
        <figcaption>
          A side-by-side comparison of <cite>Variety</cite>'s web application
          running in Safari next to the same application once added to the
          homescreen, on the left and right respectively. Variety's web
          application makes use of Apple's proprietary switch so to make sure
          that once it's launched from iOS's homescreen the application
          integrates with the OS. As seen on the right, this means that browser
          chrome, including the navigation buttons, ability to bookmark, and
          the URL and search bar, have all been removed by iOS.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Windows 8 also provides similar capabilities, but in two different
        forms: one allows a user to "Add site to Apps", meaning that a shortcut
        icon to a web application is added amongst natively installed
        applications. This is shown below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/add_to_apps.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          In Windows 8, "adding a site to apps" makes a website appear amogst
          other apps. Once added, the launch icon is treated identically from
          other applications. Once clicked, the web application is opened in
          Internet Explorer.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The second type of bookmarking supported by Internet Explorer is
        pinning: this adds the site as a "live tile" to the homescreen. To best
        support this functionality, the developer needs to include some
        proprietary metadata for the icons and for how often the tile should be
        updated. The site is not actually presented in the live tile, but an
        RSS feed is used instead.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/pin.jpg" alt="">
        <figcaption>
          On the left, the facility that allows a site to be "pinned" to the
          Windows 8 homescreen. On the right, the result of pinning a site is
          shown. Note that the content shown in the tile comes from an RSS
          feed, and not from the HTML of the site itself.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        What initially started as a way to add a link to the homescreen has
        incrementally evolved to diminish the functional differences between a
        web application and a native application. This has not happened on the
        OS level alone: progress on the web platform, such as the ability to
        make content available off-line, performance gains through hardware
        acceleration, and integration with native form controls, has assisted
        in diminishing these differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it should be noted that being able to have bookmarks outside the
        web browser is not something particularly new or noble. Desktop
        browsers have had that capability for possibly over a decade. However,
        giving developers the choice to tightly integrate their web
        applications into the OS directly from the Web browser is still
        somewhat new (hence all the proprietary switches and fragmentation in
        this space). This is different from packaged applications (zipped-up
        HTML applications) or hybrid application (applications that are
        distributed as native applications, but rely on a Webview), in that
        they applications are "installed" directly from the browser itself
        rather than from an app store.

          Key components of the "standalone" web application
        </h3>
        <p>
          Web Applications that opt-into being run standalone have somewhat
          different requirements to web applications a user has bookmarked to
          the homescreen. This is because OS level facilities of interacting
          with and controlling native applications are different from those of
          a web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for a web application to be "installed" in such a way that
          it provides a user experience that is indistinguishable from that of
          a native application, a number of key things are needed. This list
          compliments the list of things needed for bookmarking:

            native application (e.g., it works offline, doesn't need a
            navigation bar, etc.), then they use some kind of switch (e.g.,
            through markup) to indicate this to the OS when the application is
            added to the homescreen. Otherwise, the installed web application
            is treated as a regular bookmark and launched in the appropriate

        Indication that the application can work standalone
      </h2>
      <p>
        As already discussed, web applications can be added to the homescreen
        of a device in such a manner that they behave just like bookmarks. That
        is, once added to the homescreen, when the icon of the web application
        is activated, a web browser is launched and the desired web page is
        loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, through various proprietary opt-in mechanisms, developers are
        able to inform the browser that the application is able to work
        "standalone": that is, it is able to function without the user
        interface chrome of a browser - which typically means an web
        application will be launched in full screen. Depending on the OS and
        browser, these opt-in mechanisms can have various side-effects. One
        such web application, <a href="http://forecase.io">Forecast.io</a>, is
        shown below running in iOS.

          application's launch icon is indistinguishable from those of other

        <p>
          In iOS, then means by which an application developer indicates that
          their application can be run "standalone" is by using a meta element
          that takes the following form:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          By declaring the above in a document, iOS will launch an application
          that has been added to the home page in fullscreen (without any
          browser chrome).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the meta tag is omitted, and a user adds a page to the home
          screen, then the web application simply opens in a tab within Safari.
        </p>
        <p>
          TODO: Discuss that a side effect is the following practice, which can
          range from the annoying to the just bad and requires browser sniffing
          (so you know where to point the "add to home screen" arrow, which is
          different on every browser). Having an API might help with this
          problem, but allowing developers to be a bit more descrete about
          adding to homescreen.

          Firefox OS lacks a way to declaratively indicate to the Web browser
          that the application can run standalone when lunched. Instead,
          Firefox OS relies on an API to provide this functionality. The
          <code>mozApps.install()</code> method takes a url to a JSON file as
          an argument. The JSON file supplies Firefox OS with the relevant
          metadata (e.g., application's name, URLs for the icons, etc.) needed
          to make installation possible.

      Security and privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      The act of adding an application to the home screen serves as a cue to
      alter the security policy of an application. For example, in iOS, and
      application that has been added to the home screen will no longer share
      cookies, localStorage, IDB, etc. with the Safari Web browser. The OS will
      also reset all its API permissions, so, for example, any previously
      granted permission to access location services that occurred in the
      browser are forgotten once the application is added to the homescreen -
      the end-user will need to re-enable such permission again after the
      application is launched from the homescreen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, by adding the application to the home screen, the
      application gains its own independent privacy settings in iOS's privacy
      menus. This is shown in the figure below.

        Navigation
      </h2>
      <p>
        The ability to navigate documents by activating hyperlinks is a
        fundamental aspect of the Web platform. It's what makes the web, the
        web. However, when applications are added to the homescreen of a
        device, and indicate that they are able to function standalone, the
        navigational behavior has some side effects. These side effects
        generally emerge because the applications are launched in full screen
        and devoid of any browser chrome, and so the are no visual indicators
        for the user to get a sense of where they are (as they normally would
        with an address bar). As such, different browsers deals with this
        problem in different ways.

          Chrome allows users to freely navigate web documents by following
          hyperlinks: this works both same origin and across origins. However,
          if a user navigates away from the origin from which the application
          was installed, a small bar with the new origin to be shown. This
          appears to be done as a security precaution to give the user a better
          sense of where they are (specially if they have unexpectedly been
          navigated to another domain).

          iOS7 Safari
        </h3>
        <p>
          On iOS, once an application is added to the homescreen,
          hyperlink-based navigation from one document to another is no longer
          possible by default: this is because in iOS, the "default behavior"
          of activating a link is to open the link in Safari (note however,
          navigating within the document itself via fragment identifiers is
          still possible). The default behavior can be prevented by capturing
          all click events generated by HTML <code>a</code> elements. Once an
          event has been captured, and prevented from performing the default
          action, then the <code>window.location</code> can be manually set by
          script. Preventing the default behavior and manually handling the
          navigation is illustrated by the code below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
document.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  var elem = e.target;
  if (elem.tagName &amp;&amp; elem.tagName === "A") {
    e.preventDefault();
    location.href = elem.href;
  }
});
</pre>
        <p>
          Once click events are captured and the default behavior prevented, it
          becomes possible not only to navigate a document within the same
          origin, but also to other origins. However, every document will need
          to include code similar to the one above in order for navigation via
          hyperlinks to continue to work.

        in the Web browser as normal. That is, the solution MUST NOT conflate
        bookmarking with allowing a web application to be launched as
        standalone.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a mechanism for the application to check (e.g., via
        script) if it's running as a standalone application.
        </li>
        <li>MAY provide a mechanism for the developer to interrogate the
        browser about what UI chrome is available (e.g., is there a navigation
        bar?).
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to include a name for the web application.
        This name is not the same as the document's title, though the document
        title could serve as the name if the name is missing.
        </li>
        <li>SHOULD provide a means to support a short name for the application.

        <li>MUST specify the default navigation behavior for a standalone
        application.

        <li>MUST clarify the security model with regards to how permissions and
        data are shared with the web browser from which the web application was
        bookmarked or installed. This could possibly allow the developer to
        opt-into (or out of) sharing cookies, storage data, etc. with the
        browser that installed the application.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to declare multiple iconic representations
        suitable for a range of contexts. In addition, the solution SHOULD
        allow developers to declare the dimensions, format, as well as a means
        to indicate the preferred device-pixel-ratio at which each icon should
        be used.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means to declare the orientation that the
        application needs to be in when launched. The solution MUST allow the
        application to fully lock to a particular orientation, or allow a
        soft-lock to a particular orientation: meaning that if the user flips
        the device 180 degrees, the document is also flipped.
        </li>
        <li>MUST provide a means that allows the developer to declare the URL
