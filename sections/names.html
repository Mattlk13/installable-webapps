<h2>
  Names
</h2>
<p>
Native applications can have multiple names. Because of this, you can
find them in multiple ways.
</p>
<p>
Web applications, because of HTML's origin as a document-publishing
format, have a "title" and these titles are applied "per page" basis
using HTML's &lt;title&gt; element. This is annoying. It means constantly
having to fix the name when you add to home screen.
</p>
<p>
HTML5 provides a solution, "application-name":
</p>
<pre class="highlight">
&lt;head&gt;
  ...
  &lt;meta name="application-name" content="Awesome App!"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
<p>
HTML5 limits this to 1 name:
</p>
<p>
HTML says:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  The value must be a short free-form string giving the name of the Web
  application that the page represents. If the page is not a Web
  application, the application-name metadata name must not be used. There
  must not be more than one meta element with its name attribute set to
  the value application-name per document. User agents may use the
  application name in UI in preference to the page's title, since the
  title might include status messages and the like relevant to the status
  of the page at a particular moment in time instead of just being the
  name of the application.
  </p>

In the <a href="https://gist.github.com/7454160">October data set</a>,
there were 1629 sites using this string. The search query used:
</p>
<pre class="highlight">
        find ./ -name "*ml.txt" | xargs grep -l "application-name" &gt;
        application-name.txt
</pre>
